# :house: About

This project contains a cpf validator developed while studying **javaScript**.

It aims to deepen my knowledge and generate something useful while I study.

---

## :rocket: Getting Started

**Then in order, clone the project.**

By HTTPS, running this command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LeoMSSilva/cpfValidator.js.git
```

Or by ssh, running this command:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:LeoMSSilva/cpfValidator.js.git
```

SSH is a secure protocol, but you need to register a key ssh in your github before.
